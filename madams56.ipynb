    "Marvel Comics, originally called Timely Comics Inc., has been publishing comic books for several decades. \"The Golden Age of Comics\" name that was given due to the popularity of the books during the first years, was later followed by a period of decline of interest in superhero stories due to World War ref. In 1961, Marvel relaunched its superhero comic books publishing line. This new era started what has been known as the Marvel Age of Comics. Characters created during this period such as Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, together with those created during the Golden Age such as Captain America, are known worldwide and have become cultural icons during the last decades. Later, Marvel's characters popularity has been revitalized even more due to the release of several recent movies which recreate the comic books using spectacular modern special effects. Nowadays, it is possible to access the content of the comic books via a digital platform created by Marvel, where it is possible to subscribe monthly or yearly to get access to the comics. More information about the Marvel Universe can be found here.\n",

We propose a framework that combines unsupervised community extraction and supervised, community-based feature weighting before training a classifier. We introduce Approximate Regularized Commute-Time Embedding (ARCTE), an algorithm that projects the users of a social graph onto a latent space, but instead of packing the global structure into a matrix of predefined rank, as many spectral and neural representation learning methods do, it extracts local communities for all users in the graph in order to learn a sparse embedding. To this end, we employ an improvement of personalized PageRank algorithms for searching locally in each userâ€™s graph structure. Then, we perform supervised community feature weighting in order to boost the importance of highly predictive communities. We assess our method performance on the problem of user classification by performing an extensive comparative study among various recent methods based on graph embeddings. The comparison shows that ARCTE significantly outperforms the competition in almost all cases, achieving up to 35% relative improvement compared to the second best competing method in terms of F1-score.',\n",
