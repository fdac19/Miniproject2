# Data Discovery Project


1. Pick a favorite topic that you care about
2. Find at least 20 datasets for that topic (use, for example,
https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch). I for one, collect ope
source git repositories, so I searched for "git urls"
3. For each of the 20 datasets determine if the data can be accessed
4. Create a mongodb collection YourNetId within the database fdac19mp2
   where you store metadata for each of the 20 datasets: YourTopic, title,
   license, description, url(s) were the data may be retrieved
